Theme: Interactivity

In this project, my aim is to create an artwork based around the theme of interactivity. My personal twist to it is the illusion of choice, creating tension with the artwork and user, forcing the user to pick options that may not be ideal.

#### How It Works
**mainPage**
- entirely black screen
- ellipses that is semi transparent that follows mouseXY
- at specified coordinates are different elements that appear only when mouseXY is within range
- particular element is a button referred to as "Oh you found me again"
- click on button to trigger next event

**newPage**
- stark contrast to mainPage
- white background
- right side of canvas comes down a lamp to further give off "turned on light" feel
- ON/OFF button
- screen has instructions provided for user, specifying to not click on the OFF button
